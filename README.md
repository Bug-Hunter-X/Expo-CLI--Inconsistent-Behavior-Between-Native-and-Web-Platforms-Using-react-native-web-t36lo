# Expo CLI: Inconsistent Behavior Between Native and Web Platforms

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue in Expo CLI development when using `react-native-web`. The problem arises from differences in how components render and behave across native and web environments.

## Problem Description:

The issue doesn't present a consistent error message. Instead, it surfaces as unexpected layout quirks, styling anomalies, or entirely broken component functionality depending on the platform.  This is often due to reliance on native modules or styling mechanisms unsuitable for web environments.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the Expo development server: `expo start`.
4. Observe the differences between the app's behavior on a native device/emulator and in a web browser.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully examining your component implementations, identifying dependencies on native modules, and ensuring consistent cross-platform styling using appropriate techniques (e.g., conditional rendering, platform-specific styling).  The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates one way of addressing the inconsistencies.

## Additional Notes:

Debugging these issues often requires careful logging and inspection of component trees to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies lie.
